  content: Assume that you have spent $ michigan_value on a ticket for a weekend ski trip to Michigan. Several weeks later you buy a $ wisconsin_value ticket for a weekend ski trip to Wisconsin. You think you will enjoy the Wisconsin ski trip more than the Michigan ski trip. As you are putting your just-purchased Wisconsin ski trip ticket in your wallet, you notice that the Michigan ski trip and the Wisconsin ski trip are for the same weekend! Itâ€™s too late to sell either ticket, and you cannot return either one. You must use one ticket and not the other. Which ski trip will you go on? A) $ michigan_value ski trip to Michigan B) $ wisconsin_value ski trip to Wisconsin
