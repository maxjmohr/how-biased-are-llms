\subsection{Experiments}
\subsubsection{Studies}
Some are choice experiments, some expect a number and then compare the answers between different questioning types.

\subsubsection{Scenarios}
- Normal (replication of original study) \\
- Random values \\
- Explicitly prompt to behave humanlike \\

Also describe how the normal prompt is structured.


\subsection{Response analysis}
Somewhere describe what the expected output of the models should look like and what I do if it is different.

\subsubsection{Replicability analysis}
Original studies and compare results. Perhaps a "bias detected" number. If always 100 experiment runs, bias detected is the percentage of runs where the model acted biased. (Between 0 and 1, perhaps normalize)

\subsubsection{Randomized controlled trials}
RCTS on randomized values as well as explicitely prompting humanlike behavior. The controll group is the normal prompt.

\subsubsection{Model comparisons}
Are there any trends between newer/larger models?
